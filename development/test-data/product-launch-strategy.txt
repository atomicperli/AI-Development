Sarah (Product Lead):
Good morning, team. We need to finalize the launch plan for “Horizon,” our new data-sharing feature. I’m concerned about the initial communication strategy. Should we go with a full public blast, or a staggered beta first?

[10:06 AM]
Mark (Marketing):
I strongly recommend a **phased rollout**. A full blast carries too much risk if we hit an unexpected bug, and we lose the chance for positive early buzz. Let's do a **private beta** to our top 50 Enterprise clients first.

[10:07 AM]
Jessica (Engineering):
From an engineering standpoint, a small beta is much safer. We can limit the load on the new API endpoints. We’re still seeing a slight **latency spike** when data volume exceeds a certain threshold.

[10:08 AM]
Mark (Marketing):
Agreed. For the private beta, I’ll need a list of clients and a key message that positions “Horizon” as a **premium, early-access benefit** for their loyalty.

[10:09 AM]
Sarah (Product Lead):
Okay, private beta it is. Let's start with a target list of **25 clients** this week. Mark, please prepare the email draft by end of day Wednesday. Jessica, can we aim to lock down the beta build and a rollback plan by Thursday?

[10:10 AM]
Jessica (Engineering):
We can do Thursday. My only concern is the **documentation**—it’s about 60% complete. The Enterprise clients will need thorough guides.

[10:11 AM]
Sarah (Product Lead):
Good point. Action item for me: I’ll check in with the technical writer to get the core documentation finalized by the end of the week. Let's plan the full public launch for **three weeks from now** once the beta feedback is green.
