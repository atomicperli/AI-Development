Chris (Finance):
The initial quote for the migration from On-Prem to Cloud-X is **$4.2 million**, which is $800,000 over our approved budget. We need to find areas to cut.

[11:01 AM]
Danielle (Infrastructure):
The biggest cost driver is the **data transfer fees**â€”moving 500 terabytes of cold storage. We budgeted for a standard transfer speed but were quoted for the faster, priority route.

[11:02 AM]
Chris (Finance):
Can we use a **slower, non-priority transfer**? The cold storage isn't time-sensitive, is it?

[11:03 AM]
Danielle (Infrastructure):
It is not. We can change the data transfer to the standard, slower tier. That immediately shaves off **$350,000** from the quote. That brings us closer.

[11:04 AM]
Elena (Security):
I still see a line item for a new, dedicated **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** instance at $150,000. Is the standard WAF bundled with Cloud-X not sufficient for the new environment?

[11:05 AM]
Danielle (Infrastructure):
You're right. The standard WAF is sufficient. I had included the dedicated instance as a contingency, but we can stick to the **bundled service**. That's another $150,000 saved.

[11:06 AM]
Chris (Finance):
Excellent. That brings us down to **$3.7 million**, which is still over. What about the project timeline? Can we extend it from 4 months to 6 months to reduce the consulting hours?

[11:07 AM]
Danielle (Infrastructure):
Extending the timeline by two months would save us approximately **$200,000 in specialized consulting fees**. I can manage that without impacting business operations.

[11:08 AM]
Chris (Finance):
Perfect. $4.2M minus $350K (transfer) minus $150K (WAF) minus $200K (consulting) equals **$3.5 million**. That is under budget. Danielle, update the SOW with the slower transfer and the 6-month timeline. We are approved.
